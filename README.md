# Simulation

This repository includes useful files for simulating satellite attitude dynamics as well as orbital mechanics, written in C++. 

matrix.hpp:
  - Matrix wrapper class that allows for MATLAB like matrix operations and chaining. 
  - Derived from the C++ array class. 


quaternions.hpp:
  - Quaternion wrapper class for performing operations between quaternion objects
  - Derived from matrix.hpp


test_funcs.cpp:
  - Unit tests for all methods


Quaternion_Notes.pdf:
  - Contains essential quaternion mechanics that I compiled.
